# *Replit*

*NOTA*: *Replit* was formerly called *Repl.it* and its address was https://repl.it. These old names and addresses can be found in documents that has not been updated.

*Replit* is an online [development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), which can be accessed via a web browser, even from a smartphone or tablet. In addition to a number of tools that facilitate the development of applications in a wide range of languages, *Replit* also makes it possible to run these applications without having anything to install, as can be seen from the many inserts on this site that are based on *Replit*.

You can access *Replit* at <https://replit.com>.

With *Replit*, you can develop your applications with all the comfort (keyboard, mouse, monitor...) that comes with PC-type computers provided by some organizations (don't forget to log off before you leave!), applications which you can then use on your smartphone or tablet.
