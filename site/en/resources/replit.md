# *Replit*

*NOTA*: *Replit* was formerly called *Repl.it* and its address was https://repl.it. These old names and addresses can be found in documents that has not been updated.

*Replit* is an online [development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), which can be accessed via a web browser, even from a smartphone or tablet. In addition to a number of tools that facilitate the development of applications in a wide range of languages, *Replit* also makes it possible to run these applications without having anything to install, as can be seen from the many inserts on this site that are based on *Replit*.

In *Replit*, an application is stored in what is called a *repl*. A *repl* can contain several applications, but in the context of *Zelbinium*, a *repl* will contain a single application.

You can run the application of a *repl*, provided its owner has made it public, without having a *Replit* account, but to modify a *repl*, or to create your own *repl*, a *Replit* account is required. 

While *Replit* offers a number of paid features, the creation of an account and the basic functions, which are more than sufficient for *Zelbinium*, are free of charge.

You can access *Replit* at <https://replit.com>.
