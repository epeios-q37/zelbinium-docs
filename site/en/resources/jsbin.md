# *JS Bin*

[*JSBin*](https://jsbin.com) is a service that renders *HTML* and *CSS* code on the fly. This service does not require an account.

It facilitates the development of *HTML*/*CSS*-coded interfaces, whose *HTML* and *CSS* code can then be copied unchanged into the source code of the applications for which they are intended.
