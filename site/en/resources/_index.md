# Ressources

- [*HTML*/*CSS*](./html): languages used in *Zelbinium* to create graphical interfaces;
- [*Python*](./python): the programming language used in *Zelbinium*;
- [*JSBin*](./jsbin/): on-the-fly rendering in a web browser of *HTML* and *CSS* code;
- [*Brython*](./brython) : *Python* interpreter in the web browser ;
- [*Replit*](./replit): *Python* in the web browser;
- [*Termux*](./termux): *Python* on *Android*;
- [*iSH*](./ish): *Python* on *iOS* and derivatives (for devices like *iPhone*, *iPad*…);
- [*Software forges*](./forges): host the source code of your applications in the cloud;
- [*Atlas* toolkit](./atk): world's lightest toolkit to easily add a GUI to your programs and bring them online.

*Replit* can also be used on a [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer), so you can work on the same application both with your smartphone or tablet, and with a computer provided by some establishments. In the latter case, make sure that your browser does not store your *Replit* account login details, and that you log out of your *Replit* account before leaving your computer.

If you have your own personal computer, you can install a Python interpreter on it ([installation procedure](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and benefit from all the comfort of an [integrated development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Similarly, you can use *Termux* on *Android*, or *iSH* under *iOS* (or derivatives), to install a *Python* interpreter on a smartphone or tablet. Transferring applications between different devices can be greatly facilitated by the use of a software forge.

Installing a *Python* interpreter means you don't need *Replit*, but you can easily transfer an application to or from *Replit*, which can also be done with a software forge, allowing it to be used in parallel...
