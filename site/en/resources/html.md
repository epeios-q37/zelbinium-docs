# *HTML* and *CSS*
    
[*HTML*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is a language used to describe the elements composing a graphical interface, with which [*CSS*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) is associated, allowing the appearance of these elements to be defined.

[*JSBin*](../jsbin/) allows you to view an interface programmed in *HTML*/*CSS* on the fly.

There is a wealth of documentation on *HTML* and *CSS*, both on the web and elsewhere (https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/HTML and https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/CSS, for example). Note that many of these documentations will mention *JavaScript*, a language associated with web technologies of which *HTML* and *CSS* are a part. However, using *HTML* and *CSS* in *Zelibinium* does not require any knowledge of *JavaScript*.
