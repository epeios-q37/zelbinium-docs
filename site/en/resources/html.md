# *HTML* and *CSS*
    
[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) is a language used to describe the elements composing a graphical interface, with which [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) is associated, allowing the appearance of these elements to be defined.

[*JSBin*](../jsbin/) allows you to view an interface programmed in HTML/CSS on the fly.
