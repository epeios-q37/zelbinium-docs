# The *Python* language

[*Python*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is considered one of, if not the most suitable language for beginners. This doesn't mean, however, that it's confined to the educational sector. It's one of the most widely used languages for professional use by people who don't do computers for a living.
