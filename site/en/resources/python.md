# The *Python* language

[*Python*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) is considered one of, if not the most suitable language for beginners. This doesn't mean, however, that it's confined to the educational sector. It's one of the most widely used languages for professional use by people who don't do computers for a living.

Its use normally requires the installation of a suitable development environment on a [personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_computer). As part of the *Zelbinium* project, we use [*Replit*](../replit), which provides a complete development environment in your browser, enabling you to write and run *Python* programs without having to install anything, even on a smartphone or tablet.

If you want to do without *Replit*, you can use *Python* on your personal computer via the [installation procedure presented on the official website](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download), or by using [*Termux*](../termux) on *Android* smartphones or tablets, or [*iSH*](../ish) on their *Apple* equivalents.
