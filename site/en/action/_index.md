# *Action!*

In this section of the site, we'll see how to perform various actions related to an application and its source code directly from a web browser. The starting point will be an insert like this one (it may take some time for the content to appear):

<div style="display: flex;">
<iframe style="margin: auto; border: groove 10px; padding: 5px;" src="https://replit.com/@Zelbinium/Messages?embed=true" width="500" height="360"></iframe>
</div>

An insert gives access to a repository hosted by [*Replit*](../resources/replit/). Such a repository is called *repl*. In *Zelbinium*, each application has its own *repl*.

The application used as an example in this section allows its users to exchange messages. The animation below shows the application being launched from one smartphone using the insert above, accessed by another smartphone by scanning a QR code, and then the exchange of a few messages between the two devices.

In the subsections below, you'll be invited to perform various actions using the buttons in the inset at the top of the page. The *Open on Replit* button in this insert displays the corresponding *repl* in its own tab; the same buttons are used as in the presentation above, so you can use either the insert or its tab display.

Here are the various subsections:

- [*Launch*](./launch): launch (run) an application;
- [*Share*](./share): share access to an application;
- [*Explore*](./explore): explore an application's source code;
- [*Modify*](./modify): modify an application's source code;
- [*Create*](./create): create your own application.

We recommend starting with the first ([*Launch*](./launch)), and working through them in the order shown above.
