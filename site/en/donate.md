# Why donate?

*Zelbinium* limits the exposure of our children to the harmful effects of social networks, the time spent programming being as much less time spent on social networks, and by allowing our children to give access to their applications on social networks, *Zelbinium* contributes to clean up their exchanges.

*Zelbinium* relies on the [*Atlas* toolkit](https://atlastk.org), a innovative software library in its use of cloud computing. Through your donations, you will support the development of this library, the financing of the servers and the bandwidth it requires, as well as the enrichment of this site, which will allow our young people to acquire, free of charge and in a fun way, a better understanding and mastery of digital technology, as well as new perspectives for their professional future.
